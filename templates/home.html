    <h1>Software Architecture Final Exam</h1>
    <h2>Facade</h2>
    <p>The design pattern used on this exam is Facade, as we are using a structural architecture to make it more easy to scale and upgrade the system
       we use it mostly when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or 
       because its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. 
       It typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client. These members access the system on behalf of the 
       facade client and hide the implementation details.</p>
