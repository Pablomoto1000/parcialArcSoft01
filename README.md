# Software Architecture Final Exam

## Facade pattern

### The facade pattern (also spelled fa√ßade) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code

```
The design pattern used on this exam is Facade, as we are using a structural architecture 
to make it more easy to scale and upgrade the system we use it mostly when a system is very 
complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent 
classes or because its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the 
larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single 
wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client. These members access the 
system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.
